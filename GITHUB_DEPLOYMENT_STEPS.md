### Configuration Files Present

- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration  
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment settings

## Next Steps After GitHub Deployment

1. **Verify Repository**: Check https://github.com/mohanviswa7/mindnote shows all files
2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to netlify.com
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect build settings from `netlify.toml`
   - Click "Deploy site"
3. **Test Live Application**: Your MindNote app will be available at the Netlify URL

## Troubleshooting

**If repository still appears empty:**
- Check you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify repository permissions (should be owner)
- Try the web interface upload method
- Ensure files were committed and pushed successfully

**If build fails on Netlify:**
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Verify all configuration files are present
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is selected in build settings

Your complete MindNote application is ready for deployment with all features working!
